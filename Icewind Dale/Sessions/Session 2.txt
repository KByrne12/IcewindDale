Hal's invocations

An image of crimson hair slowly reaching from behind you and encompassing you. the hold isn't tight but instead it feels warm and comforting
from within the darkness you see a gentle smile directed at you. At first it feels like a smile full of care but as you look upon it for a moment
longer you notice that the gaze feels not only caring, but also sad. The warmth from the hair enveloping you surges once more as the being speaks
in a voice from all directions and it's tone undiscernable, despite its feminine appearance, the voice is indistinguishable from male or female:
"My child.. I have seen how your journey begins and I fret I have not prepared you well enough. I worry for your safety. Among these dense storms
are countless beasts and entities that have yet to be discovered by man. To this end I grant you my second gift to you. Along with your ability to
reach into my well of power, I give thee the eyes to see as I do. To see beyond the physical and see the very essence that makes up the things around
you. But this will not be enough to fight back the horrors of this tundra, I shall open my well further for you. When next you call for my aid in battle
I will eliminate all foes before you. Now go forth, your journey is just beginning, and the path you must take will soon be opened before you."

The entity then fades from view. when you wake and look out the window you see a faint sparkle come from the carvings on the nearby buildings, just as soon to fade.


barkeep song (94) if they eat at the inn, if they are just passing through they just hear her hum but not actual words

"Ahead of winter's wind she came-
The lovely woman with no name
raped in a fur-lined cloak of red,
to the icey lake she fled;
the wind pursued her all the same-
as sure as night she's dead
