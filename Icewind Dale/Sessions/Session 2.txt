Hal's level up / invocations (Evan)

goes to sleep normally. level up happens in the morning.

An image of crimson hair slowly reaching from behind you and encompassing you. the hold isn't tight but instead it feels warm and comforting
from within the darkness you see a gentle smile directed at you. At first it feels like a smile full of care but as you look upon it for a moment
longer you notice that the gaze feels not only caring, but also sad. The warmth from the hair enveloping you surges once more as the being speaks
in a voice from all directions and it's tone undiscernable, despite its feminine appearance, the voice is indistinguishable from male or female:
"My child.. I have seen how your journey begins and I fret I have not prepared you well enough. I worry for your safety. Among these dense storms
are countless beasts and entities that have yet to be discovered by man. To this end I grant you my second gift to you. Along with your ability to
reach into my well of power, I give thee the eyes to see as I do. To see beyond the physical and see the very essence that makes up the things around
you. But this will not be enough to fight back the horrors of this tundra, I shall open my well further for you. When next you call for my aid in battle
I will eliminate all foes before you. Now go forth, your journey is just beginning, and the path you must take will soon be opened before you."

The entity then fades from view. when you wake and look out the window you see a faint sparkle come from the carvings on the nearby buildings, just as soon to fade.

Thokin's level up
You sit down in your room gently tapping on your drum. toying around with different beats and tones you begin
to dose off a little allowing your eyes to close but your hands continue to play. a gentle beat reminiscent of home
slowly becomes louder and louder filling your ears and thoughts. giving you different visions of familiar people
and things. a campsite, a totem, a story, the beginning of your journey. and a familiar face that you have grown
to long. upon seeing their face your vision snaps back to reality and you are sitting in the same place. Hands
no longer playing the drum but the beat still resonating in your chest.

Tumult's level up
After arriving at your chambers at the church of umberlee, the bitch queen, you kneel before your personal altar 
you have set up in your own room for privacy. After a moment of prayer you feel a rough but dainty hand grasp
your shoulder. After a momentary gasp you turn to glance at your shoulder to see nothing there. Shortly following
a whisper in your ear followed by the phrase "wake them up my child. they are lost in their own visions of how
the world should be. wake them and let them see my divine presence". the final word disappears with a whisp and
all is silent in your room again.


Tumult wakes first the next day to begin her journey to meet up with the others.

Thokin wakes up second, if he goes downstairs the barkeep is singing.

Hal wakes up a little late due to his vision with the entity first thing in the morning.


barkeep song (94) if they eat at the inn, if they are just passing through they just hear her hum but not actual words
Martha Peskryk (lawful good human teenager)
-father(fisherman) is bedridden and she cares for him when not working the inn
"Ahead of winter's wind she came-
The lovely woman with no name
raped in a fur-lined cloak of red,
to the icey lake she fled;
the wind pursued her all the same-
as sure as night she's dead
