Halvaren Fellrune(Hal) - Female gnome
Warlock: Celestial Patron
patron: Sune - love, beauty, passion
Sune is a mortal enemy of auril due to auril destroying many beautiful things

bullied when young for wanting to be a hero -> why she became an adventurer
in search for fame / glory
knows how terrible people are so mainly just wants the glory

traveled to Icewind Dale to prove she is a hero

patron reached out to b4 icewind dale

-> became a folk hero

-> out of desire for more heroism

-> heard of a magic item lost somewhere in the frozen north called the Summer Star(pg 116 black cabin)
	-wants to use this to fix the endless winter of the frozen north and return peace to icewind dale
	-wants this to be her tale as a folk hero

-> went to icewind dale

-> drawn to Termalaine by Sune due to its beauty as a symbol for beginning

secret:
grew up in a town of cannibals
thought it was okay until their friend that came into town had their head caved in after being told
after being fed that person that night Hal slowly leaned away from cannibalism
still has cravings of eating people when the chance is offered one way or another
for this reason they hate lying and can often be seen as abrassive
